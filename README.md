## Setup Environment

### Swift

### IDE

We'll be presenting this content using [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

This is the entry point to static "runners" that contain code to help you upload, manage and transform your media.


### Install Swift

- We are using Swift version 5.9.2 in the course
- You can find [instructions for downloading and installing Swift ](https://www.swift.org/install/) for many environments.

### Verify your version of Swift is 5.9+

```
swift -version

```
Sample output for Version 5.9.2

```bash
$ swiftc -version
swift-driver version: 1.87.3 Apple Swift version 5.9.2 (swiftlang-5.9.2.2.56 clang-1500.1.0.2.5)
Target: arm64-apple-macosx14.0
```

CLOUD_NAME and API_KEY can be revealed without creating any security issues, but you must keep API_SECRET private. Itâ€™s strongly recommended not to keep your API Secret anywhere within the app code.


Don't check it into GitHub and don't include it in blog posts.
- For this course, you only need your cloud name, so there won't be any risk of security.
